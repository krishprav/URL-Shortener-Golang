# URL Shortener

A modern, mobile-friendly URL shortener built with Go (backend) and Next.js with Tailwind CSS (frontend).

## Features
- Shorten long URLs to easy-to-share short links
- Responsive, clean UI with glassmorphic design
- Copy-to-clipboard button for short URLs
- Info popup explaining the app
- In-memory storage (easy to add a database for persistence)
- CORS enabled for easy deployment with static frontends
- Animated star background
- macOS-style window interface

## Getting Started

### 1. Run Locally

#### Backend (Go)
1. Make sure you have Go installed (`go version`)
2. Clone this repo and `cd` into the project directory
3. Run:
   ```sh
   go run main.go
   ```
4. The server will start on `http://localhost:8080`

#### Frontend (Next.js)
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```sh
   cd url-shortener-go
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Create `.env.local` file:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8080
   ```
4. Run the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

### 2. Deploy to Production

#### Backend
- Deploy `main.go` to a platform that supports Go web servers (Render, Railway, Fly.io, etc.)
- Set environment variables:
  - `PORT`: 8080 (usually auto-set by platform)
  - `BASE_URL`: Your deployment URL (auto-generated by Render)
- CORS is enabled by default

#### Frontend
- Deploy the Next.js app to Vercel, Netlify, or any platform that supports Next.js
- Set environment variable:
  - `BACKEND_URL`: Your deployed backend URL

## Environment Variables

### Backend
- `PORT`: Server port (default: 8080)
- `BASE_URL`: Base URL for short links (auto-generated by platform)

### Frontend
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL`: Backend API URL (e.g., `https://your-app.onrender.com`)

## Customization
- To persist URLs, connect the Go backend to a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, Redis)
- To change the UI, edit the React components in `url-shortener-go/src/components/`
- To modify the design, update the Tailwind classes and CSS
